**Title:** Self-Driving Car Emergency Response – Emergency Maneuver

**Raw:**

# Requirements: Self-Driving Car Emergency Response

## Goal  
Ensure that when a self-driving car detects an obstacle, it can simultaneously engage emergency braking and compute a new route to safely navigate around the obstacle.

## Actors  
- **Autonomous Vehicle (AV):** Detects obstacles and initiates the emergency response.  
- **Vehicle Control Unit (VCU):** Analyzes the situation and coordinates safety and navigation actions.  
- **Safety System (SS):** Responsible for engaging emergency braking.  
- **Navigation System (NS):** Calculates an alternative route.

## Preconditions  
- The autonomous vehicle is operating and its sensors detect an obstacle.  
- The Safety System and Navigation System are active and responsive.

## Triggers  
An obstacle is detected by the vehicle’s sensor suite.

## Scenario  
1. The Autonomous Vehicle detects an obstacle and notifies the VCU.  
2. The VCU analyzes the situation and simultaneously initiates two parallel interactions:  
   - **Emergency Braking:** Sends a command to the Safety System to engage emergency braking.  
   - **Rerouting:** Requests a new route from the Navigation System.  
3. The Safety System engages emergency braking, and the Navigation System computes a new route concurrently.  
4. Once both actions complete, the VCU updates the vehicle’s status (indicating braking is active and a new route is available) and logs the event.

**Clean:**  
**Actors:** Autonomous Vehicle (AV), Vehicle Control Unit (VCU), Safety System (SS), Navigation System (NS)  
**Preconditions:** AV sensors detect obstacle; SS and NS are available.  
**Triggers:** Sensor suite detects obstacle.

**Flow:**  
1. AV → VCU: Detect obstacle  
2. VCU → VCU: Analyze situation  

3. par Emergency actions  
   VCU → SS: Initiate emergency braking  
   activate SS  
   SS --> VCU: Braking engaged  
   deactivate SS  
   
   VCU → NS: Request new route  
   activate NS  
   NS --> VCU: New route calculated  
   deactivate NS  
end  

4. VCU → AV: Update status (braking & new route available)  
5. VCU → VCU: Log emergency event  

**Postconditions:** Vehicle is braking, new route ready, and event logged.
