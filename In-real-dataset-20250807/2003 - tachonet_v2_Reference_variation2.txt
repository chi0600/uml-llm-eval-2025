Prompt: 
Generate a sequence diagram using PlantUML from these requirements so that I can provide it to Planttext to visualize it.

Requirements:
Use Case 02 – Check tachograph card status

Goal:
Check the status of a tachograph card by its card number and issuing Member State code. This is used by Card Issuing Authorities (CIA) to verify card validity (and by enforcement authorities during road checks).

Basic Flow:
1. TACHOnet deciphers the received request and logs it as-is in its tracking database.
2. TACHOnet validates the request syntax and assigns a TCNRefId.
3. TACHOnet builds new sub-requests based on the issuing Member State code provided for each card.
4. For each identified issuing Member State, TACHOnet logs, encrypts, and sends a sub-request to the respective Member State CIA and waits for a response.
5. For each received response, TACHOnet deciphers it, logs it as-is, validates its syntax, and if valid, stores the response message (linked to the TCNRefId) in the database.
6. When all responses are received or a timeout occurs, TACHOnet builds, logs, encrypts, and sends a consolidated response to the original requester.

Postconditions:
An encrypted consolidated response is sent back to the requester.
