Prompt: 
Generate a sequence diagram using PlantUML from these requirements so that I can provide it to Planttext to visualize it.                                                                                                            
Requirements:
Use Case 3
Scope: IFA Digital System
Level: Scheduling
Primary Actor: Referee, IFA Scheduling Committee member
Stakeholders: Referee, IFA, Teams
Main Success Scenario:
1. The IFA Scheduling committee plans to schedules the games.

make a schedule.
5. The IFA Scheduling committee member enters the dates referees are available on.
