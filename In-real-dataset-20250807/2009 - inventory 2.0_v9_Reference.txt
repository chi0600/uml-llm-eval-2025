Prompt: 
Generate a sequence diagram using PlantUML from these requirements so that I can provide it to Planttext to visualize it.                                                                                                            
Requirements:
3.9. Receive Acquisition
A donor in possession of a valid acquisition number can proceed to the receiving dock where the items to be donated will be received and processed, and a donation receipt will be generated. Alternatively, a donor may go directly to the receiving dock, in which case a new acquisition is created by the Receiving Associate before items can be received and processed.
The screens used for the acquisition process should simplify and expedite the data entry process, allowing the Receiving Associate to enter only the information needed to generate the donation receipt. Additional attributes needed to complete the item information and effectively add the item to the inventory can be added at a second step, after the receipt has been printed and the donor has been served. The Receiving Associate can print temporary acquisition labels for items that require further processing.
Pick Up and Decon crews may also initiate the receiving process, entering as much detailed information about the donated items as desired, and generating a donation receipt. They cannot, however, add items to the inventory or complete the acquisition process. A Receiving Associate is required to review all the acquisition information before those actions can take place.
