Prompt: 
Generate a sequence diagram using PlantUML from these requirements so that I can provide it to Planttext to visualize it.

Requirements:
Use Case 05 – Get Phonex Search Keys

Goal:
Obtain computed search keys (using the Phonex algorithm) for a driver's surname and first names.

Description:
The use case is invoked by a CIA (or an enforcer via a CIA) when issuing a new card. The request includes the driver's surname and first names. TACHOnet validates the input, computes the search keys, and returns them. If the input is invalid, a negative status code is returned.

Basic Flow:
1. The CIA calls the TACHOnet service with the driver’s surname and first names.
2. TACHOnet validates the input parameters.
3. If valid, TACHOnet computes the corresponding search keys.
4. TACHOnet returns the computed search keys as output parameters.

Alternate Flow:
2a. If the input parameters are invalid (e.g. contain illegal characters), TACHOnet returns a negative status code.

Pre-conditions:
The caller provides the mandatory input parameters.

Post-conditions:
The caller receives the computed search keys or a negative error code.

Reference Response:
