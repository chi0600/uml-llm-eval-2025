Generate a sequence diagram using PlantUML from these requirements so that I can provide it to Planttext to visualize it.                                                                                                            
Requirements:
3.8. View Acquisitions
Acquisition records for Drop-Off, Pickup and Decon donations are created in the CRM system. Inventory Management users should be able to view all past and current acquisitions. Receiving Associates use this function to locate an expected acquisition when receiving a donation at the loading dock. Pickup and Decon crews may also use this function to initiate the process of receiving items while in the truck, on their way to the receiving dock.
Drop Off acquisitions are not typically pre-scheduled as Pick Up and Decon acquisitions except for those submitted through the organizational website. As such, when a donor arrives with an unexpected drop off donation, a new acquisition needs to be able to be created in the CRM system first, at either the customer service desk or at the dock, before it can be viewed in the acquisitions screen.
