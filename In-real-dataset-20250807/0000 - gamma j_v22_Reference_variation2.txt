Prompt: 
Generate a sequence diagram using PlantUML from these requirements so that I can provide it to Planttext to visualize it.

Requirements:

Login Customer

Goal:
Login to a customer account with the system.

Actors:
- Customer
- Weborder System

Preconditions:
Customer account must already be registered.

Customer clicks the button or link to "Login"

Basic Scenario:
1. Customer clicks the button or link to initiate the login process.
2. System prompts the customer for email and password.
3. Customer enters the login credentials.
4. System verifies the information.
5. System creates a session cookie.
