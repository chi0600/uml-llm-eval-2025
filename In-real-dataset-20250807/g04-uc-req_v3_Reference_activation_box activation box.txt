Prompt: 
Generate a sequence diagram using PlantUML from these requirements so that I can provide it to Planttext to visualize it.                                                                                                            
Requirements:
Name of Use Case: UC2: Urban traffic flow during big events analysis
Scope Traffic flow management application
Level User goal
Primary actor Urban mobility planner
Stakeholders and Interests
- Users (urban mobility planners, media team of the urban mobility
department): needs real time analysis of urban mobility, to be able to
find the best solution to improve traffic flows during big events.
- Emergency services (police, ambulance, firefighters): wants to be able to
see where high risk areas are, what the effect of certain big events are on
certain congestion points (and how these can be improved).
- The Mayor of Wonderland: wants to accepts plans to improve traffic
congestions only when all stakeholders and their interests have been
considered (money, noise, pollution etc.).
- Residents: wants less congested traffic, but the solution must be fair
(noise, pollution).
Preconditions - The system has retrieved all relevant sensory data and is ready to
simulate.
- The user is authenticated to use the system (logged in).
Postconditions Cause and effect of different scenarios regarding urban traffic are shown in realtime.
Main Success 
Scenario:
1. The user authenticates and is logged into the system.
2. The system shows the traffic flows of the city, based on historic data.
2.1 Congested traffic flows are shown in red.
3. The user specifies a big event at a certain building/area with an expected
number of visitors.
4. The system shows the traffic flows from before and after the event.
5. The user selects can tinker around with traffic flow management
solutions (blocking certain roads off, redirecting traffic, etc.)
6. The system shows the updated traffic flow.
7. The user retrieves a report of suggested traffic flow measurements and
plan of action generated by the system (simulated data).
Special 
Requirements:
1. Data must be stored locally (by the municipality, not in the cloud).
2. Process in real-time; show results directly.
3. No technical expertise is needed to use the system (user friendly).
