Generate a sequence diagram using PlantUML from these requirements so that I can provide it to Planttext to visualize it.

# Requirements: Generate Order Summaries

## Goal
Allow a user to request an order summary that processes multiple items in their cart sequentially.

## Actors
- **User** – Initiates the summary request.
- **E-Commerce System** – Retrieves cart details and processes each item.
- **Inventory Service** – Provides pricing and availability details for each item.

## Preconditions
- The user must have an active cart.
- The E-Commerce System and Inventory Service are both available.

## Triggers
- The user clicks the “View Order Summary” button.

## Basic Scenario
1. The user requests an order summary from the E-Commerce System.
2. The E-Commerce System retrieves the list of items in the user’s cart.
3. The system enters a loop, iterating over each cart item:
   - For each item, it queries the Inventory Service for up-to-date pricing and availability.
   - The Inventory Service returns the item details.
4. After all items are processed, the E-Commerce System calculates the total cost and applicable taxes.
5. The system returns the completed order summary to the user.

## Alternative Scenario
- If the Inventory Service fails or times out for an item, the E-Commerce System logs the error, skips that item, and continues with the next item in the loop.

actor User
participant "E-Commerce System" as ECS
participant "Inventory Service" as IS

User -> ECS: Click "View Order Summary"
activate ECS

ECS -> ECS: Retrieve cart items

loop For each Item in Cart
    ECS -> IS: Request Item Details
    activate IS
    alt Inventory Service Succeeds
        IS --> ECS: Return Pricing & Availability
    else Inventory Service Fails or Times Out
        ECS -> ECS: Log error (skip item)
    end
    deactivate IS
end

ECS -> ECS: Calculate total cost & taxes
ECS --> User: Display Order Summary
