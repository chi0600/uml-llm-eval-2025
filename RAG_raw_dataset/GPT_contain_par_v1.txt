# Requirements: Self-Driving Car Emergency Response

## Goal
Ensure that when a self-driving car detects an obstacle, it can simultaneously engage emergency braking and compute a new route to safely navigate around the obstacle.

## Actors
- **Autonomous Vehicle (AV):** Detects obstacles and initiates the emergency response.
- **Vehicle Control Unit (VCU):** Analyzes the situation and coordinates safety and navigation actions.
- **Safety System (SS):** Responsible for engaging emergency braking.
- **Navigation System (NS):** Calculates an alternative route.

## Preconditions
- The autonomous vehicle is operating and its sensors detect an obstacle.
- The Safety System and Navigation System are active and responsive.

## Triggers
- An obstacle is detected by the vehicle’s sensor suite.

## Scenario
1. The Autonomous Vehicle detects an obstacle and notifies the VCU.
2. The VCU analyzes the situation and simultaneously initiates two parallel interactions:
   - **Interaction 1:** Sends a command to the Safety System to engage emergency braking.
   - **Interaction 2:** Requests a new route from the Navigation System.
3. The Safety System engages emergency braking, and the Navigation System computes a new route concurrently.
4. Once both actions complete, the VCU updates the vehicle’s status (indicating braking is active and a new route is available) and logs the event.
