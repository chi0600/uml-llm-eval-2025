Generate a sequence diagram using PlantUML from these requirements so that I can provide it to Planttext to visualize it.

# Requirements: Service Request

## Goal
Allow a customer to submit a service request after ensuring they are logged in by a login process.

## Actors
- **Customer**: Initiates the service request.
- **Service Portal**: Manages the overall request flow.
- **Authentication Service**: Handles the login process.
- **Order Processing**: Handles order inquiries.
- **Support Desk**: Handles support requests.

## Preconditions
- The customer may not yet be logged in when starting a service request.
- The common login process is available for reuse.

## Triggers
- The customer submits a service request.

## Basic Scenario
1. The customer initiates a service request via the Service Portal.
2. The Service Portal invokes the login process to ensure the customer is authenticated (Refer to Login Process).
3. After successful login, the Service Portal routes the request to the appropriate handler:
   - If it’s an order inquiry, the request goes to Order Processing.
   - If it’s a support issue, the request goes to the Support Desk.
4. The chosen system processes the request and returns a response to the customer.

Reference Response:
@startuml
title Service Request

actor Customer
participant "Service Portal" as SP
participant "Auth Service" as AS
participant "Order Processing" as OP
participant "Support Desk" as SD

Customer -> SP: Initiate Service Request
activate SP

' Reuse the common login process as an embedded interaction:
ref over Customer, AS 
  Common Login Process
end ref

alt Request is for Order Inquiry
  SP -> OP: Process Order Inquiry
  OP --> SP: Return Order Details
else Request is for Support
  SP -> SD: Process Support Request
  SD --> SP: Return Ticket Confirmation
end

SP --> Customer: Return Service Response
deactivate SP
