# Requirements: Order Shipment

## Goal
Process an order shipment and, if the customer opted for shipment insurance, process the insurance and send policy details.

## Actors
- **Customer**: Places the order and may opt in for shipment insurance.
- **Logistics Management System (LMS)**: Manages order shipments and coordinates optional insurance processing.
- **Shipping Carrier (SC)**: Handles pickup and delivery of the order.
- **Insurance Service (IS)**: Processes shipment insurance if requested.

## Preconditions
- The order is ready for shipment.
- The customer has either opted for shipment insurance or not.
- LMS is integrated with both the Shipping Carrier and the Insurance Service.

## Triggers
- The order is finalized and ready to be shipped.

## Scenario
1. The LMS schedules the order pickup and delivery with the Shipping Carrier.
2. The Shipping Carrier confirms the shipment.
3. If insurance was selected:
   - The LMS contacts the Insurance Service to process shipment insurance.
   - Once processed, the LMS sends the insurance policy details to the customer.
4. The LMS notifies the customer that the order has been shipped.
